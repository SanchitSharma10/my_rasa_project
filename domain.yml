  - text: i wish you luck.
  utter_faq/intent_32:
  - text: i know. i think it may rain.
  utter_faq/intent_33:
  - text: it's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today.
  utter_faq/intent_34:
  - text: that would be weird.
  utter_faq/intent_35:
  - text: yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside.
  utter_faq/intent_36:
  - text: i know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.
  utter_faq/intent_37:
  - text: yes, it would be.
  utter_faq/intent_38:
  - text: i really wish it wasn't so hot every day.
  utter_faq/intent_39:
  - text: me too. i can't wait until winter.
  utter_faq/intent_40:
  - text: i like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold.
  utter_faq/intent_41:
  - text: i'd rather be cold than hot.
  utter_faq/intent_42:
  - text: me too.
  utter_faq/intent_43:
  - text: you're right. i think it's going to rain later.
  utter_faq/intent_44:
  - text: in the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining.
  utter_faq/intent_45:
  - text: that wouldn't seem right.
  utter_faq/intent_46:
  - text: considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird.
  utter_faq/intent_47:
  - text: exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining. it's too hot.
  utter_faq/intent_48:
  - text: i know, you're absolutely right.
  utter_faq/intent_49:
  - text: i wish it would cool off one day.
  utter_faq/intent_50:
  - text: that's how i feel, i want winter to come soon.
  utter_faq/intent_51:
  - text: i enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes.
  utter_faq/intent_52:
  - text: i know what you mean, but i'd rather be cold than hot.
  utter_faq/intent_53:
  - text: that's exactly how i feel.
  utter_faq/intent_54:
  - text: that is true. i hope it doesn't rain.
  utter_faq/intent_55:
  - text: it wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer.
  utter_faq/intent_56:
  - text: it wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now.
  utter_faq/intent_57:
  - text: it would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather.
  utter_faq/intent_58:
  - text: any rain right now would be pointless.
  utter_faq/intent_59:
  - text: that's right, it really would be.
  utter_faq/intent_60:
  - text: i want it to cool down some.
  utter_faq/intent_61:
  - text: i know what you mean, i can't wait until it's winter.
  utter_faq/intent_62:
  - text: winter is great. i wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though.
  utter_faq/intent_63:
  - text: i would rather deal with the winter than the summer.
  utter_faq/intent_64:
  - text: yes, it is.
  utter_faq/intent_65:
  - text: it looks like it may rain soon.
  utter_faq/intent_66:
  - text: yes, and i hope that it does.
  utter_faq/intent_67:
  - text: why is that?
  utter_faq/intent_68:
  - text: i really love how rain clears the air.
  utter_faq/intent_69:
  - text: me too. it always smells so fresh after it rains.
  utter_faq/intent_70:
  - text: yes, but i love the night air after it rains.
  utter_faq/intent_71:
  - text: really? why is it?
  utter_faq/intent_72:
  - text: because you can see the stars perfectly.
  utter_faq/intent_73:
  - text: i really hope it rains today.
  utter_faq/intent_74:
  - text: yeah, me too.
  utter_faq/intent_75:
  - text: it really is.
  utter_faq/intent_76:
  - text: it seems that it may rain today.
  utter_faq/intent_77:
  - text: hopefully it will.
  utter_faq/intent_78:
  - text: how come?
  utter_faq/intent_79:
  - text: i like how clear the sky gets after it rains.
  utter_faq/intent_80:
  - text: i feel the same way. it smells so good after it rains.
  utter_faq/intent_81:
  - text: i especially love the night air when it rains.
  utter_faq/intent_82:
  - text: really? why?
  utter_faq/intent_83:
  - text: the stars look so much closer after it rains.
  utter_faq/intent_84:
  - text: i really want it to rain today.
  utter_faq/intent_85:
  - text: yeah, so do i.
  utter_faq/intent_86:
  - text: yes, i think so too.
  utter_faq/intent_87:
  - text: i think that it's going to rain.
  utter_faq/intent_88:
  - text: i hope that it does rain.
  utter_faq/intent_89:
  - text: you like the rain?
  utter_faq/intent_90:
  - text: the sky looks so clean after it rains. i love it.
  utter_faq/intent_91:
  - text: i understand. rain does make it smell cleaner.
  utter_faq/intent_92:
  - text: i love most how it is at night after it rains.
  utter_faq/intent_93:
  - text: how come?
  utter_faq/intent_94:
  - text: you can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains.
  utter_faq/intent_95:
  - text: i would love for it to rain today.
  utter_faq/intent_96:
  - text: that sounds like fun. what's the weather going to be like?
  utter_faq/intent_97:
  - text: i heard that it's going to be warm this weekend.
  utter_faq/intent_98:
  - text: is it going to be perfect beach weather?
  utter_faq/intent_99:
  - text: i believe so.
  utter_faq/intent_100:
  - text: good. i hope it doesn't cool off this weekend.
  utter_faq/intent_101:
  - text: i know. i really want to go to the beach.
  utter_faq/intent_102:
  - text: but you know that california weather is really unpredictable.
  utter_faq/intent_103:
  - text: you're right. one minute it's hot, and then the next minute it's cold.
  utter_faq/intent_104:
  - text: i really wish the weather would just stay the same.
  utter_faq/intent_105:
  - text: i do too. that way we can have our activities planned ahead of time.
  utter_faq/intent_106:
  - text: yeah, that would make things a lot easier.
  utter_faq/intent_107:
  - text: a trip to the beach would be fun. how is the weather going to be?
  utter_faq/intent_108:
  - text: the forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend.
  utter_faq/intent_109:
  - text: so do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach?
  utter_faq/intent_110:
  - text: it sounds like it will be.
  utter_faq/intent_111:
  - text: i really hope it doesn't get cold.
  utter_faq/intent_112:
  - text: that would ruin things, i want to go so badly.
  utter_faq/intent_113:
  - text: the weather in california is unpredictable, so you never know.
  utter_faq/intent_114:
  - text: that is true. the weather is constantly changing.
  utter_faq/intent_115:
  - text: it would be nice if the weather would never change.
  utter_faq/intent_116:
  - text: that would be great, then we could plan things sooner.
  utter_faq/intent_117:
  - text: true. predictable weather would make life easier.
  utter_faq/intent_118:
  - text: what's the weather going to be like? i may want to go too.
  utter_faq/intent_119:
  - text: the weather this weekend is supposed to be warm.
  utter_faq/intent_120:
  - text: will it be good beach weather?
  utter_faq/intent_121:
  - text: i think it will be.
  utter_faq/intent_122:
  - text: it wouldn't be good if it got cold this weekend.
  utter_faq/intent_123:
  - text: i want this trip to be perfect, i hope it stays warm.
  utter_faq/intent_124:
  - text: this california weather is so uncertain, it's impossible to know what'll
      happen.
  utter_faq/intent_125:
  - text: i know. every day the weather seems different.
  utter_faq/intent_126:
  - text: i would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable.
  utter_faq/intent_127:
  - text: that would make it easier for us to make plans.
  utter_faq/intent_128:
  - text: this is she. how's it going?
  utter_faq/intent_129:
  - text: i've been trying to call you all day.
  utter_faq/intent_130:
  - text: sorry about that. i was cleaning up.
  utter_faq/intent_131:
  - text: it's okay.
  utter_faq/intent_132:
  - text: so what were you calling me about?
  utter_faq/intent_133:
  - text: oh, i just wanted to see if you wanted to hang out tomorrow.
  utter_faq/intent_134:
  - text: sure, what did you want to do?
  utter_faq/intent_135:
  - text: maybe we can go see a movie or something.
  utter_faq/intent_136:
  - text: that sounds like fun. let's do it.
  utter_faq/intent_137:
  - text: i'll see you tomorrow then.

  utter_faq/intent_151:
  - text: i've called you a hundred times today.
  utter_faq/intent_152:
  - text: i was busy doing something. i apologize.
  utter_faq/intent_153:
  - text: no problem.
  utter_faq/intent_154:
  - text: did you need something?
  utter_faq/intent_155:
  - text: do you want to do something tomorrow?
  utter_faq/intent_156:
  - text: is there somewhere special you wanted to go?
  utter_faq/intent_157:
  - text: how about a movie?
  utter_faq/intent_158:
  - text: a movie sounds good.
  utter_faq/intent_159:
  - text: call me tomorrow then.
  utter_faq/intent_160:
  - text: no, i haven't.
  utter_faq/intent_161:
  - text: she's really pretty.
  utter_faq/intent_162:
  - text: describe her to me.
  utter_faq/intent_163:
  - text: she's not too tall.
  utter_faq/intent_164:
  - text: well, how tall is she?
  utter_faq/intent_165:
  - text: she's about five feet even.
  utter_faq/intent_166:
  - text: what does she look like, though?
  utter_faq/intent_167:
  - text: she has pretty light brown eyes.
  utter_faq/intent_168:
  - text: i may know which girl you're talking about.
  utter_faq/intent_169:
  - text: so you have seen her around?
  utter_faq/intent_170:
  - text: yes, i have.
  utter_faq/intent_171:
  - text: i haven't seen her yet.
  utter_faq/intent_172:
  - text: i think that she is very pretty.
  utter_faq/intent_173:
  - text: tell me how she looks.
  utter_faq/intent_174:
  - text: she's kind of short.
  utter_faq/intent_175:
  - text: what height is she?
  utter_faq/intent_176:
  - text: she's probably about five feet.
  utter_faq/intent_177:
  - text: that's nice, but tell me what she looks like.
  utter_faq/intent_178:
  - text: the first thing i noticed was her beautiful brown eyes.
  utter_faq/intent_179:
  - text: i think i might've bumped into her before.
  utter_faq/intent_180:
  - text: are you telling me that you've seen her before?
  utter_faq/intent_181:
  - text: i believe so.

  utter_faq/intent_188:

  utter_faq/intent_189:
  - text: she has light brown eyes, absolutely beautiful.
  utter_faq/intent_190:
  - text: i think i know who you're talking about.
  utter_faq/intent_191:
  - text: have you seen her?
  utter_faq/intent_192:
  - text: i wasn't really feeling well.
  utter_faq/intent_193:
  - text: what was wrong with you?
  utter_faq/intent_194:
  - text: my stomach was upset.
  utter_faq/intent_195:
  - text: do you feel better now?
  utter_faq/intent_196:
  - text: i don't really feel too well yet.

  utter_faq/intent_212:
  - text: my stomach was bothering me.
  utter_faq/intent_213:
  - text: are you feeling any better?

  utter_faq/intent_217:
